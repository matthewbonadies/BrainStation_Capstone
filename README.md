### Project Overview
... ... ...

Utilizing machine learning, we aim to decipher extensive player data and scoring records across courses annually featured on the PGA Tour. We can then build a model that empowers us to pinpoint the most crucial statistics contributing to success on any given course and align them with players currently excelling in those statistical domains. Among the pivotal metrics in professional golf in recent times is the "Strokes Gained" statistic, dissecting players' performances across putting, approach shots, around-the-green play, driving accuracy, and driving distance. It focuses on how well a player fares in each category relative to the field's average.
