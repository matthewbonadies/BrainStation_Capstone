## Project Overview

### **Introduction**
The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that takes historical data from the PGA (Professional Golf Association) Tour and predicts the scores any given player will shoot in their next tournament based on their past performance. While the predictions have a broad range of applications, our primary focus will be on their utility in the context of sports betting. The landscape of sports betting has significantly transformed following the Supreme Court's 2018 decision to reverse the federal law banning sports betting. With approximately 38 states legalizing sports betting in various forms and the legal online sports betting market in the U.S. reaching over $10 billion in 2023, there's a growing demand for sophisticated analytical tools to navigate this booming industry. As a former competitive golfer with a deep understanding of the sport and its data, I aim to merge my passion for golf with advanced analytics to develop this machine learning model.

### **Problem**
The challenge lies in the overwhelming volume of detailed golf data, which, while rich in insights, can be daunting to analyze effectively. This data encapsulates a broad spectrum of performance metrics, making it difficult to discern the critical factors influencing matchup outcomes. These obstacles make it difficult for professionals and fans alike to effectively use the right information to enhance their grasp of the competitive landscape and employ effective betting strategies for the long-term.

### **Vision**
With this project, our goal is to fill the void in easily accessible, data-driven insights regarding PGA Tour results, providing individuals with the tools needed to confidently understand and navigate the complexities of sports betting. We seek not just to analyze betting intricacies using machine learning but also to deepen the sports community's comprehension and involvement with golf.

## Supporting Materials
### **What is Golf?**  
Golf is a sport played on vast outdoor courses, each featuring 18 holes scattered across several thousand yards. Players aim to sink the ball in each hole using the minimum strokes possible. The game's simplicity in objective masks its strategic depth, requiring a wide range of shots from long drives to short, precise chips. Courses include Par 3's, Par 4's, and Par 5's, with the Par number indicating the expected number of strokes to complete the hole, from the starting point, or Tee Box, to the hole which is located on the putting green. The combination of these holes sets a standard course par, usually at 72 strokes, against which players' performances are measured.
  
### **What is the PGA Tour?**  
At the pinnacle of this sport is the PGA Tour, where around 120 competitors partake in a four-day tournament, playing one round daily from Thursday to Sunday. The winner is the player with the lowest total strokes. Distinguished from many sports by its non-stop calendar, the PGA Tour introduces a new event every week in varied locations, continuously presenting fresh challenges and engaging spectators with its dynamic blend of competition and changing landscapes.

### **What is Sports Betting?**
Sports betting is a form of gambling where individuals place wagers on the outcome of various sports events. Unlike many other forms of gambling that are purely chance-based, sports betting can involve a degree of skill and knowledge about the sports, teams, and athletes involved. Hereâ€™s a basic breakdown of how sports betting works:
  
- **Odds**: Odds represent the likelihood of an event happening. They determine how much a bettor can win if their bet is successful.
- **Types of Bets**: There are many types of bets that can be placed, ranging from simple bets on which team will win a game (Moneyline Bets) to more complex bets involving the margin of victory (Point Spread Bets) or the total points scored (Over/Under Bets).
- **How to Bet**: Bets can be placed through various channels, including online betting apps and traditional brick-and-mortar casinos.
  
Successful bettors research teams, analyze statistics, and follow sports news closely to make informed decisions. While there's always an element of luck involved, having a well-thought-out strategy can improve one's chances of winning.

### **What is Golf Betting?**
Golf betting involves placing wagers on various outcomes related to golf tournaments. Unlike team sports, golf is an individual sport, which adds unique elements to betting. Here's an overview of the most common golf bets:
  
 - **Tournament Winner**: Betting on a player to win the tournament outright. It's straightforward but challenging due to the large field.
 - **Top 5, 10, 20 Finish**: Wagering on a player to finish in the top 5, 10, or 20. Offers lower odds than betting on the winner but is a bit easier to predict.
 - **Head-to-Head Matchups**: This involves betting on one player to outperform another specific player. The focus is on the overall performance rather than just the top positions. This method is most similar to betting in other sports, where you predict the outcome between two competing teams.
